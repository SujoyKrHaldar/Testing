                        <p>Have you ever wondered how websites adjust to different devices, like tablets, desktop, 
                            iPad or smartphones? Or why your website has trouble doing the same? The reason is simple.
                             If your website is not designed for that function, it will not respond to the needs of the 
                             users and the devices they're using. A responsive website can anytime give a better browsing 
                             experience to a user and are also recommended for Search Engine Optimization .Even Google, 
                             considers mobile-friendly websites when it comes to ranking websites based on user searches.
